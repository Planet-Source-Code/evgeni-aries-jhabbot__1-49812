### Description

This piece of code was created by me but now since i have no use for it check it out. Basicly the program connects with socket compoments to the fuse server HabboHotel.com and contains a client sock and sends custom data and thats it but to add all the info together it comes up to to that it basicly connects recieves sends then custom sends.Dunno if this code is useful.Great code to learn spliting and a little bit of variable array looping :)
